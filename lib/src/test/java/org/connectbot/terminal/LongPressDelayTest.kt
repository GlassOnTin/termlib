/**
 * #435: tapping a zellij tab opened Haven's copy interface instead of clicking.
 *
 * Long-press starts a Haven-local selection in every session so tmux/zellij
 * users keep the visible select-and-Copy workflow. That made a *click* in a
 * mouse-mode app race the system long-press timeout — aiming carefully at a
 * small target (a zellij tab, a tmux pane border) beats it, so the press became
 * a selection and the app never saw the click. Only quick taps got through,
 * which is why the feature looked like it already worked.
