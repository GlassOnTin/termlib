/**
 * Tests for [TerminalScreenState.getHyperlinkUrlAt], the multi-line URL
 * resolver used for tap-to-open hyperlinks on the terminal canvas.
 *
 * Regression coverage for the "whitespace gobbling" bug reported by
 * the Haven maintainer: the pre-fix implementation stripped every
 * whitespace run between URL-safe characters in the joined raw text,
 * without any notion of row boundaries. That meant a URL followed by
 * real English prose on the **same row** would have the intervening
 * spaces collapsed, and `URL_REGEX` would then greedily match all the
 * prose characters onto the URL. Example:
 *
 *     "see https://github.com/.../issues/78.  i think the is about..."
 *
 * became:
 *
 *     "https://github.com/.../issues/78.ithinktheisabout..."
 *
 * The fix keeps within-row whitespace intact and only joins rows that
 * are genuine URL continuations (previous row ends URL-safe, next row
 * starts URL-safe *at column 0* — no leading indentation allowed).

    // for URLs that appear in tool output (Claude Code transcripts,
    // markdown tables, piped indented logs). The current implementation
    // does NOT pass all of these; they are the target spec.
    //
    // Core rules:
    //   1. A `https://` / `http://` / `ftp://` anchor on any row starts
    //      URL collection.
    //   2. On a continuation row, strip any leading run of whitespace OR
    //      formatting characters (box-drawing, markdown-table pipes, list
    //      markers, etc.) before deciding continuation.
    //   3. After stripping, if the row begins with a URL-safe char and
    //      the URL-safe run contains at least one `/`, it counts as a
    //      continuation of the previous row's URL.
    //   4. A mid-row whitespace run INSIDE what would otherwise be a URL
    //      ends the URL at the whitespace (tool padding, not real URL).
    //   5. Three consecutive non-continuation rows after an anchor
    //      confirms the URL has ended and we should stop walking.
    //
    // Naming convention: prefix every case with `spec_` so it's obvious
    // which belong to the new spec vs the legacy cases above.
