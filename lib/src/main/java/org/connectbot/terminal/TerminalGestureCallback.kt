     * Return `true` from [MouseDragPhase.Start] to claim the gesture — the
     * terminal will then route subsequent moves and the end here, and skip
     * its built-in scroll handling. Returning `false` from Start lets the
     * terminal fall back to scroll-via-wheel-events as before. The return

     * claimed for the rest of that gesture.

     * remote can do its own selection across its own scrollback. Without
     * motion forwarding, the remote sees only press+release and can't
     * select anything. (#94)
