/**
 * Terminal emulator using libvterm via JNI.
 *
 * This class provides terminal emulation without PTY management.
 * The caller is responsible for:
 * - Creating and managing the PTY
 * - Reading data from PTY and feeding to writeInput()
 * - Handling onKeyboardInput() callback and writing to PTY
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - All native calls are protected by a non-reentrant mutex
 * - Callbacks MUST NOT call back into Terminal methods (will deadlock)
 * - Safe to call from multiple threads (serialized by native mutex)
 *
 * That native mutex serialises calls against each other, but it cannot make
 * destruction safe: it is a member of the `Terminal` that `nativeDestroy`
 * deletes, so it dies with the object it would have to outlive. Lifetime is
 * therefore this class's problem, and [withPtr] is where it is solved — see
 * the note there before adding a method that touches [nativePtr].

     * **Every** native call goes through here. The old shape —
     *
     * ```
     * checkNotClosed()
     * return nativeWriteInputArray(nativePtr, …)
     * ```
     *
     * — reads the pointer twice with a window in between, and frees the object
     * from a place that window cannot see. Two ways that crashes, both of which
     * land as a native SIGSEGV on whichever thread was running:
     *
     * 1. Nothing here calls [close]. The only thing that frees the native
     *    terminal is [finalize], on the GC's finalizer thread. Once `nativePtr`
     *    has been loaded into a register, `this` is never touched again, so the
     *    collector may decide the object is unreachable and finalize it *while
     *    the native call is still executing* — `delete term` underneath a live
     *    `vterm_input_write`. This is the hazard `reachabilityFence` exists for.
     * 2. An explicit `close()` on another thread, should one ever be added,
     *    lands between the check and the use for the ordinary reason.
     *
     * `synchronized(this)` answers both with one mechanism: it makes the check,
     * the read and the call atomic against [close], and a held monitor is a GC
     * root, so the receiver cannot be finalised for as long as the native call
     * is running. Reading into a local means the pointer passed to native is
     * provably the one that was checked.
     *
     * Lock order is always JVM monitor → native mutex, so this cannot invert
     * against the native lock. The existing rule still stands: a callback must
     * not synchronously re-enter these methods — the JVM monitor is reentrant
     * and would let it through, and the non-recursive native mutex would then
     * deadlock exactly as it does today.
